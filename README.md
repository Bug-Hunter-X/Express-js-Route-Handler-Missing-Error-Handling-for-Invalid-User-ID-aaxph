# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the provided code lacks validation for the user ID parameter, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes if the ID is not a valid integer.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug Description

The route handler attempts to parse the `userId` as an integer using `parseInt()` without checking if the input is a valid number. If a non-numeric value is passed as the `userId`, `parseInt()` will return `NaN`, causing the `find()` method to fail silently or throw an error, depending on the structure of the `users` array. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation before attempting to parse the `userId`. This ensures that the handler gracefully handles invalid inputs, preventing crashes and unexpected behavior.
